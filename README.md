    <h2>What is Interactive Visualization?</h2>
    <hr size="2">
    <div>
        <b>Interactive visualization</b> technology enables the exploration of data via the 
        manipulation of chart images. Thus one can interact with the chart and manipulate it 
        according to one's own needs. Thus it is more favourable to analyze a data from various
        fronts.
        <br>
        I have used <b>Plotly and Cufflinks</b> to show some Interactive visualizations in 
        the datset.

        <h3>Measures of Central Tendency</h3>
        <p>A measure of central tendency describes a set of data by identifying the central 
            position in the data set as a single value.</p>
        <li>
            <b>Mean</b> :The arithmetic mean of a given data is the sum of all observations divided 
            by the number of observations.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Median</b> : The value of the middlemost observation, obtained after arranging the data 
            in ascending order, is called the median of the data.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Mode</b> : The value which appears most often in the given data i.e. the observation 
            with the highest frequency is called a mode of data.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Percentile : </b>This forms the basis for Box plot. If say, 25th percentile 
            is given as 50 , then it means that 25% of the data have values less than or 
            equal to 50. When percentile is 50 , it is referred to as the Median. 25 percentile 
            and 75 percentile are referred to as 1st Quartile and 3rd Quartile respectively.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Relation Between Mean, Median and Mode </b>: The three measures of central values 
            i.e. mean, median, and mode are closely connected by the following relations 
            (called an empirical relationship). 
            <br>
            <b>2Mean + Mode =3Median</b>
        </li>
        <h3>Measures of Dispersion</h3>
        <li>
            <b>Range :</b>It is the differenec between the maximum and the minimum value of the 
            variable 
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Inter-Quartile Range (Q<sub>3</sub>-Q<sub>1</sub>):</b>It is the difference 
            between the 3rd Quartile and the 1st Quartile. <b> Note: </b>Any value of a 
            variable lying above 1.5*Q<sub>3</sub> or below 1.5*Q<sub>1</sub> are considered 
            to be outliers. It is one of the ways to get rid of the outliers in the dataset.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Variance : </b>Average of squared deviations from the Arithmetic Mean.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Standard Deviation :</b>Square root of the variance.
        </li>
