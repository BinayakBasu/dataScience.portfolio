    "Each object in Python has a type, a value, and an identity. When we write greet = \"hello world\" we are creating an instance of a string object with the value \"hello world\" and the identity of greet. The identity of an object acts as a pointer to the object's location in memory. The type of an object, also known as the object's class, describes the object's internal representation as well as the methods and operations it supports. Once an instance of an object is created, its identity and type cannot be changed.\n",

They have methods, such as insert() or append(), that change an objects value. Immutable objects, such as strings,cannot have their values changed, so when we run their methods, they simply return avalue rather than change the value of an underlying object. We can, of course, use this value by assigning it to a variable or using it as an argument in a function."

    "\n",
    "The format() reads the type of arguments passed to it and formats it according to the format codes defined in the string.\n",
    "\n",
    "For positional arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "Positional arguments\n",
    "Here, Argument 0 is a string \"Adam\" and Argument 1 is a floating number 230.2346.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Argument list starts from 0 in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "The string \"Hello {0}, your balance is {1:9.3f}\" is the template string. This contains the format codes for formatting.\n",
    "\n",
    "The curly braces are just placeholders for the arguments to be placed. In the above example, {0} is placeholder for \"Adam\" and {1:9.3f} is placeholder for 230.2346.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the template string references format() arguments as {0} and {1}, the arguments are positional arguments. They both can also be referenced without the numbers as {} and Python internally converts them to numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Internally,\n",
    "\n",
    "Since \"Adam\" is the 0th argument, it is placed in place of {0}. Since, {0} doesn't contain any other format codes, it doesn't perform any other operations.\n",
    "However, it is not the case for 1st argument 230.2346. Here, {1:9.3f} places 230.2346 in its place and performs the operation 9.3f.\n",
    "f specifies the format is dealing with a float number. If not correctly specified, it will give out an error.\n",
    "The part before the \".\" (9) specifies the minimum width/padding the number (230.2346) can take. In this case, 230.2346 is allotted a minimum of 9 places including the \".\".\n",
    "If no alignment option is specified, it is aligned to the right of the remaining spaces. (For strings, it is aligned to the left.)\n",
    "The part after the \".\" (3) truncates the decimal part (2346) upto the given number. In this case, 2346 is truncated after 3 places.\n",
    "Remaining numbers (46) is rounded off outputting 235.\n",
    "\n",
    "For keyword arguments\n",
    "Keyword argument\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We've used the same example from above to show the difference between keyword and positional arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, instead of just the parameters, we've used a key-value for the parameters. Namely, name=\"Adam\" and blc=230.2346.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since these parameters are referenced by their keys as {name} and {blc:9.3f}, they are known as keyword or named arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Internally,\n",
    "\n",
    "The placeholder {name} is replaced by the value of name - \"Adam\". Since it doesn't contain any other format codes, \"Adam\" is placed.\n",
    "For the argument blc=230.2346, the placeholder {blc:9.3f} is replaced by the value 230.2346. But before replacing it, like previous example, it performs 9.3f operation on it.\n",
    "This outputs   230.235. The decimal part is truncated after 3 places and remaining digits are rounded off. Likewise, the total width is assigned 9 leaving two spaces to the left.\n",
